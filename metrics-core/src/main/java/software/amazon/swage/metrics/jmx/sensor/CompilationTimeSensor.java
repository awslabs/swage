/**
 * Records compilation time metrics as reported by the CompilationMXBean.
 *
 * Useful for seeing how much latency is attributable due to the JVM still
 * interpreting bytecode on-the-fly.  Will emit a metric for total time spent
 * in compilation and amount of compilation time spent since the last time
 * this {@link Sensor} was run.
 * 
 * Most Java services see a significant impact in latency when they bounce the
 * JVM.  Though this warm-up can be due to service level caching, there is a
 * large chunk of it that is due to JIT warm-up and compilation time.  With
 * this metric, service owners can get more visibility into how much JVM
 * compilation time is impacting their top-level latencies.  This visibility
 * can provide service owners with a quick time to resolution of latency
 * investigations.
