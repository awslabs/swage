/**
 * MetricRecorder that sends all metric events to CloudWatch.
 * <p>
 * This recorder attempts to adhere to CloudWatch best practices by aggregating
 * metrics client side and publishing periodically to CloudWatch in batches.
 * <p>
 * Metrics are aggregated by metric name, unit, and context id.
 * Calls to {@link #record} and {@link #count} with the same {@link Metric}
 * label, the same {@link Unit}, and the same Context.ID value will be added
 * together to form a single {@link StatisticSet}. The timestamps of individual
 * metric events are lost in the aggregation.
 * <p>
 * The aggregated metrics are periodically collected and published to
 * CloudWatch using the client provided in the constructor. The publishing
 * period is configurable at construction time, defaulting to 60 seconds.
 * <p>
 * CloudWatch does not recommend publishing at frequencies less than 1 minute,
 * since they don't do aggregation at any granularity smaller than that.
 * However, publishing at frequencies greater than 1 minute will cause 1 minute
 * aggregates to be lost. As such it is highly recommended that a value of 60
 * be used for the publish frequency
 * <p>
 * A random jitter is applied for the initial delay, bounded by maxJitter.
 * This helps prevent all of the hosts/processes in an application from
 * publishing at the same instant, spreading the requests more evenly over
 * time.
 * <p>
 * Note that we use a single thread executor to perform the publishing. That
 * means if a single publish attempt takes a long time, i.e., because of a lot
 * of metrics or because of retries due to throttling/outage, subsequent
 * attempts will be delayed. This is generally a good thing, especially if the
 * delay is due to throttling. During the delay, {@link CloudWatchRecorder}
 * will continue to collect metrics and add values to be aggregated so that
 * subsequent calls will have more metrics aggregated so we can make fewer
 * calls to CloudWatch.
